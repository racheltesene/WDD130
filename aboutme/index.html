   <p>
    My name is Rachel Tesene and I am from Kansas.This is my third semester as a computer science major.
    <br>Some things that I love to do include playing video games like Skyrim and Elden Ring, baking and 3D printing.
    <br>Most people I've asked, tend to not like html But I quite liking it! Especially once you add the css, 
    <br>seeing your work displayed on a web page is really satisfying and rewarding.
   </p>
   <p>I'm not the most confident about myself, 
    <br> but I hope that I can make many connections and friends in this class and future classes to come.</p>
